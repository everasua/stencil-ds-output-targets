# @stencil-labs/react

React integration for Stencil Web Components.

## Overview

The `@stencil-labs/react` package provides a seamless integration between the component wrappers generated by the Stencil React output target and React.

Uses the amazing [@lit/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/react) package.

## Features

- üåê **React Integration**: Automatically wraps Stencil-generated components as React components.
  - Properties are camel-cased.
  - Events are camel-cased and prefixed with `on`. For example, `myEvent` becomes `onMyEvent`.
- ‚å®Ô∏è **TypeScript Support**: Provides TypeScript definitions for Stencil-generated components, including prop types and event handlers.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Custom Element Support**: Supports custom elements in React applications. Automatically defines custom elements for Stencil-generated components.

## Installation

In the React library or application that contains the generated Stencil React components, install the `@stencil-labs/react` package:

```bash
npm install @stencil-labs/react
```

Developers consuming your React library or application **do not** need to install `@stencil-labs/react` directly.

## Usage

`@stencil-labs/react` serves as a dependency for integrating Stencil-generated React components into your application. There are no direct usage instructions for this package; it is automatically utilized by the generated Stencil React components.
